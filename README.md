By default numbers not in your contacts are blocked.

Optionally allow:
* Numbers you have contacted
* Numbers within the selected groups
* X registered call(s) from the same number within a set amount of minutes
* Numbers found in messages
* Numbers passing STIR verification (Android 11)

If the app rejects calls from contacts on Android 10, allow contacts permission manually in 
`App info â†’ Permissions`.

## Permissions

* CALL_SCREENING - block or allow call
* READ_CALL_LOG - check you have called the number and count times the number have called you in T minutes
* READ_SMS - check you have sent a message to the number and you received a message from the number
* RECEIVE_SMS - find mobile numbers in incoming messages
* READ_PHONE_STATE - check on which SIM the number is calling
* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - persist clean expired numbers job across reboots
* READ_CONTACTS - check the number exists in contacts on Android 10
