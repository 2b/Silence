Call screening app.

Block phone numbers that are not saved in your contacts list.

Optionally:

- allow numbers that you have called
- allow numbers with toll-free codes (ex: 800)
- allow a third call from the same number within five minutes (cache constraint)
- allow temporary mobile numbers from incoming text messages
