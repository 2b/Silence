Block unknown callers with call screening service.

By default block phone numbers that are not saved in your contacts list.

Optionally:<br>
allow numbers that you have called<br>
allow numbers with toll-free codes (ex: 800)<br>
allow a third call from the same number within five minutes (cache constraint)<br>
allow mobile numbers from incoming text messages temporarily<br>
allow numbers that passed STIR verification (android 11)

If app rejects calls from contacts on android 10, allow contacts permission manually in app info > permissions.
