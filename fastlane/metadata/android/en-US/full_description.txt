Block unknown callers with this call screening service.

By default numbers not in your contact list are blocked.

Optionally allow:<br>
Numbers you have called<br>
Numbers with toll-free codes (ex: 800)<br>
A third registered call from the same number within five minutes<br>
Mobile numbers from incoming text messages temporarily<br>
Numbers passing STIR verification (Android 11)

If the app rejects calls from contacts on Android 10, allow contacts permission manually in App info â†’ Permissions.
