By default numbers not in your contacts list are blocked.

Optionally allow:
* Numbers you have contacted
* Numbers within the selected groups (Toll-Free, Local)
* N registered call from the same number within T minutes
* Numbers from messages
* Numbers passing STIR verification (Android 11)

Contacted, Groups, Repeated options and the main toggle have additional settings. You can open them
by long click.

If the app rejects calls from contacts on Android 10, allow contacts permission manually in
App info â†’ Permissions.
