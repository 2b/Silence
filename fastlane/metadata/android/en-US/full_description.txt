Block unknown callers with this call screening service.

By default numbers not in your contact list are blocked.

Optionally allow:
* Numbers you have called
* Numbers with toll-free codes (ex: 800)
* A third registered call from the same number within five minutes
* Mobile numbers from incoming text messages temporarily
* Numbers passing STIR verification (Android 11)

If the app rejects calls from contacts on Android 10, allow contacts permission manually in App info â†’ Permissions.
